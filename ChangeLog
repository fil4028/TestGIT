2002-07-13 Mikhail Yakshin <greycat@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Release 0.4.1

	* Fixed lots of TSE3 issues. Now KGuitar requires TSE3 0.2.x
	(0.2.3 or later recommended) to work and its MIDI capabilties are
	solely based on TSE3. All the stuff that works with MIDI (MIDI
	export, MIDI song playback, chord player, etc) were unified under
	the control of single TSE3 library and nothing else. Should work
	with most if not all available Unix MIDI interfaces: both older
	and newer ALSA, OSS, aRts, etc.

	* Added configuration options for TSE3 playing and exporting of
	TSE3MDL file format. MIDI export is rewritten using TSE3
	functions - now it should be more flexible.

	* Basic MusicXML support. MusicXML is leading interchange format
	for exchanging musical data between various applications. For more
	info, see www.recordare.com.

	* Native tabulature printing with Qt/KDE interfaces with effect
	support, multi-track & multi-page printing.

	* New tabulature effects and features: slide, triplets, let ring.

	* Added basic and pretty faulty, but somewhat working for simple
	files Guitar Pro 2 import support. Any assistance with hacking on
	more features of this format is welcome.

	* Slight sorting of chords in chord constructor: better chords are
	on top.
	
	* Lots of bug fixes, more ideological tweaking.

2001-12-10 Mikhail Yakshin <greycat@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Release 0.4

	* Major change in whole application song handling ideology, now
	it's much straighter. MIDI output reworked to follow new model.

	* Implemented multitracking support -- with all the necessary
	things list separate track listing panel, inserting/removing
	unlimited amount of tracks, separate track navigation panel, etc,
	etc.

	* Implemented basically functional drum track mode.

	* Added special feature for automatic bass line generation from
	rhythm track.
	
	* Added editing options: cut, copy & paste, undo/redo. Selections
	are possible with Shift + arrow keys.

	* New strumming pattern rule --- much more flexible now, allowing
	chords or parts of chords rhythms.
	
	* Much more accurate and less flicker-prone tabulature redrawing
	code --- now repaints only things that are needed to be
	repainted. Many more convenience options, like fast navigation via
	track navigation panel and ensuring that cursor is always visible.

	* Lots of various bugfixes, especially with chord constructor and
	track integrity.

2001-09-22 Alexander Brand  <alinx@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Release 0.3-pre

	* Changed automake/autoconf stuff to KDE2 standard one in admin directory.

	* Ported to KParts as browser extension. The KGuitar tab view is now a
	KPart. KG-files can viewed with Konqueror like PDF-Files.

	* MIDI playback support (required libkmid to compile - it's available in
	kdelibs-sound package). Basic MIDI playback implemented in chord constructor
	and tabulature view. It's a new unstable feature and feedback about it (how
	it works on different systems/soundcards) is highly appreciated.

	* Added option in configure script: MIDI playback for tabs
	can be enabled with './configure --with-midisupport'

	* Added MIDI options.

	* New strumming shemes are added.

	* Moved file export/import to file save/open.

	* Added drum track mode template - basically function-less, but it's a
	template for further track modes coming in future.

	* Up-to-date translation for de, fr, it.


2000-11-09 Mikhail Yakshin <yakshin@online.ru>

	* Release 0.2.9

	* Port to KDE2

2000-10-14  Mikhail Yakshin  <yakshin@online.ru>

	* Release 0.2.1

	* Lots of work done in separated mini-project (developing ALSA
	sequencing C++ classes for MIDI playback), though in this branch
	lots of changes too.

	* Loading and saving options implemented (at last)

	* Working MIDI export - lots of work, but it worthed it. Exports
	in MIDI files, format 0. Honors all track properties and some
	effects (harmonics).

	* Renewed resizable chord dialog made with layouts.	

	* Strumming patterns in chord constructor. Now it's possible to
	insert a chord as an arpegio or picked with pre-defined
	pattern. Small library of patterns is supplied with this version.
	
	* Tabulature printing via MusiXTeX and custom macros. You'll need
	to export the song via "Export/MusiXTeX tab" and then you get a
	ready-to-use tex-file. Process it with TeX as usual and print it.

	* Several new tunings in library, including banjo, mandolin and
	brahms 8-string guitar.
	
	* Fixed several bugs, fixed "mixed" notenames (with proper
	sharp/flat combinations), etc.

2000-09-08  Mikhail Yakshin  <yakshin@online.ru>

	* Release 0.2

	* Second big milestone release. Lots of changes, a month of work.

	* Total rewrite of internal track structures to use dynamic arrays
	(QArrays) instead of lists. List stuff was really ugly and hard to
	use (tabs really require direct access due to its nature). These
	changes touched almost every piece of code, including saving /
	loading schemes, tab displaying and more.
	
	* Tabulature editor: improved greatly.

	* It understands now various time signatures and separation of
	whole music piece in measures. Columns can have various durations,
	including dotted durations (1.5x the duration, as in classic
	notescores) and linked durations (to make possible weird durations
	such as 5/16 or something like that).

	* Automatical bar arranger that understands splitting notes of bar
	margins (with linking) and simplifying the tab by joining similiar
	columns into one. Note duration bars are linked in classic notes
	manner.
	
	* Basic mouse navigation to those who find keyboard navigation
	hard to use.

	* Basic effect support, just to demonstrate the technology.
	Current effects include natural and artificial harmonics and
	legato. More effects should be added soon.

	* Toolbar and statusbar made more functional. Statusbar now shows
	the current bar number and toolbar pretends to have useful
	buttons.

	* Various note naming, american (CDEFGAB), european (CDEFGAH) and
	jazz schemes (CDEFGABH), with various flats & sharps.

	* I18n suport. This release has ru and fr program message i18n
	files (po-files).

	* Chord construction is improved too: chord list comes sorted now
	(from the simpliest name to the most sophisticated), selecting a
	chord name there makes all necessary selections, reduced
	flickering. Many programming optimizations and clarifications
	mostly invisible to the user.

	* Tunings: added new tunings, fixed string thickness scale to be
	more informative.

	* Lots of bug fixes.

2000-08-08  Mikhail Yakshin  <yakshin@glasnet.ru>

	* Release 0.1

	* The first official public version. This one should be announced
	on Freshmeat and that kind of sites.

	* New basic tabulature editor. It still lacks some extended
	features like full support of effects, but the basic functionality
	is here and ready to use. Right now it's controlled only by
	keyboard, so take a look at the keyboard controls in the README
	file.

	* Chord finder is optimized much more. On my P200 it works as fast
	as Guitar Pro's one, but our version has much more features. Chord
	dialog code was cleanded up a little and new chord inversion
	control was added - be sure to check it out! Bass note control
	still isn't here, just because I couldn't find anywhere the
	accurate music theory definition of alternating bass note chords.

	* Songs could be saved and loaded in KG format (KGuitar native
	format). This format is pretty extensible and flexible and should
	be as backward compatible as possible.

	* Songs have the following properties: title, author name,
	transcriber name, comments.

	* Everything's ready for multiple tracks, though in this release
	I've not made a multitracking yet. You can edit the properties of
	each track using Edit/Track dialog, including the number and
	tuning of strings (be sure to check out the cool string thickness
	icons), number of frets, etc.

	* Pretty working exporting to ASCII tabs, so you can type in your
	tabulatures easily in KGuitar and export it to internet text-only
	form for wide usage. Importing ASCII tabs is on the way.

	* Exporting MIDI code is there, but it has fatal bugs and thereby
	disabled. If you want to play with it - enable it in sources, but
	it's broken.

	* Small options dialog just to show what degree of customizability
	we plan to implement in KGuitar. You can choose what symbols to
	describe dominant 7th chords you like the most and what symbols
	should be used for note alteration.

	* Lots of bugfixes, check the CVS logs if you care.

2000-07-15  Mikhail Yakshin  <yakshin@glasnet.ru>

	* Release 0.0.2
	
	* A working release, could be helpful for somebody. Includes a pretty	
	  good chord dialog, with both chord finder and chord analyzer almost
	  totally rewritten.

	* Chord finder now works *much* faster due to precalculation. Interface
	  allows to find most chords (like major/minor, 7th, sus2, sus4, 9, 11,
	  etc). Filter found chord, based on its complexity on 3 basises: usual
	  chords, rare chords and all chords. Also, takes care about showing
	  only root forms (tonic note is bass note).
	
	* Chord analyzer now works totally different, it tries to disassemble
	  a chord from a tonic note to steps, and then assembles step record
	  again into readable chord form, thus detecing very weird (but
	  sometimes useful chord forms, such as Em6/9sus4 or C7add11 (no3)).
	  Compared to Guitar Pro chord analyzer that works on similiar concepts,
	  this chord analyzer detects more chord forms (but currently lacks
	  changed bass note detection, like Dm/E).
