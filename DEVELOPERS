Instructions for new developers or just casual users
====================================================

Building KGuitar module, checked out from CVS
=============================================

After a checkout, you'll get a directory, named "kguitar" (that's where this
file resides). To build KGuitar from just checked out module, do the following:

1) make -f Makefile.dist

That would create all required autoconf's configure scripts and automake's
Makefile.in makefiles.

2) ./configure; make; make install

As usual.

Releasing a new version
=======================

Remember, the tags look like "rel0-1".

* Update version numbers everywhere
* Commit everything to CVS repository
* Tag everything in CVS with tag "rel<version>-<number>"
* Do "cvs log -r<lastrelease>:<currentrelease> >cvslog"
* Make a ChangeLog release entry, based on result cvslog file.
* Export everything from CVS, add the new ChangeLog
* Do "make -f Makefile.dist dist"
* Changed main directory name to "kguitar-<versionnumber>"
* Pack all the thing into tarball
* Test new release
