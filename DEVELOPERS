Instructions for new developers or just casual users
====================================================

Building KGuitar module, checked out from CVS
=============================================

After a checkout, you'll get a directory, named "kguitar" (that's where this
file resides). To build KGuitar from just checked out module, do the following:

1) make -f Makefile.cvs

That would create all required autoconf's configure scripts and automake's
Makefile.in makefiles.

2) ./configure; make; make install

As usual.



Releasing a new version
=======================

Remember, the tags look like "rel0-1".

* Update version numbers everywhere:
	configure.in.in
	VERSION
	kguitar.spec	
* Commit everything to CVS repository
* Tag everything in CVS: "cvs tag -R rel{version}-{number} ."
* Do "cvs log -r<lastrelease>:<currentrelease> >cvslog"
* Make a ChangeLog release entry, based on result cvslog file.
* Export everything from CVS, add the new ChangeLog
* Do "make dist"
* Test new release



Update translations
===================
* Change in top source directory
* Do "make clean" (because we didn't translate *.moc.cpp files)
* Do "make package-messages"
* Change to 'po' directory
* Update xx.po
