                       A KDE tabulature editor

KGuitar is basically a guitar tabulature editor for K Desktop
Environment. It's much more than just a tab editor. It's features are:


* Free GPLed program;

* K Desktop Environment GUI;

* Powerful and convenient tabulature editing, including many effects
and classical note score editing for classic instrument players;

* Full and very customizable MIDI to tabulature import and export;

* Support of extra data formats, such as ASCII tabulatures or popular
programs' format, such as Guitar Pro's or TablEdit;

* Chord fingering construction tools - chord finder & chord analyzer;

* Highly customizable to suit a lot of possible instruments (not only
6-stringed guitars, and even not only guitars), including drum tracks,
lyrics and other MIDI events.


Well, right now KGuitar is in very alpha state and doesn't support
everything stated. However, it already features a nice tabulature
editor, though not ultimately powerful, loading/saving its own format (kg
files) and all the chord construction tools.

As the KDE style docs are still not available, I'd try to give some
directions on usage of KGuitar here:

MAIN WINDOW
===========

It's a generic KDE application that you're familiar with. All the
File/Edit/etc menus are here. The most interesting thing is what is
below the menus :) It's a tab editor area.

Tab editor could be basically navigated by a mouse (just click on a
column to move a cursor there), but most editing is done by keyboard
in this release, so it won't hurt to learn these keys:

Left, Right - move the cursor on previous/next column;

Up, Down - move the cursor on previous/next string;

Number keys - edit the fret number in cursor position. To enter simple
one-digited fret number just press the apropriate key. To enter
2-digit fret number (such as 12, for example), press keys "1" and "2"
consequentally - they'll add up to the 12 fret number. Note that
you'll be unable to enter invalid fret numbers - for example 36th fret
on the 24 fret guitar.

X - makes the current string sound with dead note. This is marked with
"X" mark in tab and sounds like a very short undetermined note.

Delete - deletes the current fret number in cursor position.

Ctrl+Delete - deletes the whole current column.

Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Down - if there is a fret number in cursor postion, move
the cursor up or down taking the number with it, trying to maintain
the tone frequency. Thus, on a normal 6-string guitar tuning, if
you'll pull the "0" from the 1st string down, it will become "5" on the
2nd string (it will still sound as E note). This way you can manually
optimize the fret fingerings without changing the sounding.

"+" and "-" keys (recommended to use keypad ones) - doubles or halves
the note length. Note lengths are shown as that familiar note-style
lines. That is:

       No note line                 whole
       Short note line              1/2
       Long note line               1/4
       Long line+1 horizontal bar   1/8
       Long line+2 horizontal bars  1/16
       Long line+3 horizontal bars  1/32

"." - add or remove dot that makes current column sound longer by one
half of it's duration. I.e. dotted column duration is 1.5x non-dotted.

L - make current column to be the continuation of previous column,
maintaining the sound, thus making it longer by the duration of
current column. Sounds complex, but that's really just links the
column with previous one to make possible durations like 5/16 (1/4 as
4/16 and 1/16 linked to it).

Shift+A - reArrange bars, according to specified time signature. It
splits the columns when needed and joins them where possible to
simplify the notation (for example, 1/4 and 1/4 will be joined into
single 1/2).

Shift+C - insert chord, starts a chord construction dialog, look below.

That were the basic editing tools. That's enough to create pretty
complex tabs.

EFFECTS
=======

Tabulature can contain various guitar-specific (and not only guitar)
effects. All these things have special symbols assigned to them. You
can add effects via either pressing a hotkey or clicking on a toolbar
item.

Supported effects so far:

H - Natural Harmonic
R - Artifical Harmonic
P - Legato (hammer on/pull off)

CHORD CONSTRUCTION
==================

For the guitarist's convenience, there is a fast chord construction
tool - a chord finder & analyzer. Just use "Insert/Chord" menu or
chord toolbar button to run it. It's pretty self-explanatory for
anybody who knows music theory, but I still want to do some notes.

To find a chord by name, just build its name in the left selection
boxes. This way, if you want to enter, for example, "Esus2/7" chord,
select "E" in the first box, "sus2" in the second and "7" in the
third.

For more complex tasks, such as chord with step alterations, like
Bm/5+, use step diagram. If you want to raise or lower a particular
step - just select a "+" or "-" there. If you want to mute a
particulat step - select "x" there. Everything's simple.

When you've got your chord entered, you'll get a lot of fingering
methods in the bottom box. Select one with a mouse there and press the
OK button - this chord would be automatically entered in the tab
editor.

Using chord analyzer is even simplier. Just set the fingering using
the big chord diagram and instantly get the result in the box near
it. It would read all somewhat reasonable naming of a given chord.

Also, for a quick creation of pretty complex rhythms, there is a
support for so-called strumming schemes. It's nothing more than just a
pre-defined pattern that states how a given chord should be played,
what strings picked and what's the notes duration should be.

Let's demonstrate on a small example. The famous song's "House of the
Rising Sun" chord progression is Am-C-D-F. If you want to tab this
song really fast, just set the 3:4 size, and call the chord
constructor. Select an Am chord first, then select a "Smooth arpegio"
from the list of strummings and just press "OK". You'll get a properly
picked Am chord instantly. Proceed with C, D and F chords in the same
way and you'll get the pretty good-sounding first line of the song.

SONG PROPERTIES
===============

Each song should have some properties - title, author name, etc. All
these things can be set up in File/Properties dialog.

Each track also has some properties. These can be accessed via
Edit/Track menu. The things that could be set up there include:

Title - title of the track; would be used in MIDI;
MIDI Channel, Bank and Patch numbers - self-explanatory;

For guitar track:

Number of string and frets - parameters of used guitar;
Tuning - the note of open string sounding. Tuning could be set up
manually or quickly selected from a library. 

Moreover, one can save and load current song in the .kg files. All
properties are also saved into the files.


MusiXTeX EXPORT
===============

It's possible to print your tabulatures. You'll need several external
things to do that:

* TeX typesetting engine. If you use Linux, use tetex from your
  distribution.

* MusiXTeX package. You can get it from the following places:
  ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/musixtex/taupin
  http://www.gmd.de/Misc/Music

The third component - a set of macros, required to typeset
tabulatures, is supplied with KGuitar. You have to install it manually
for now, so just copy file "kguitar/kgtabs.tex" to the MusiXTeX
directory (it's something like /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/musixtex).
After this run as root the program: 'texhash'. 

Okay, when you have everything installed and ready to go, do the
following:

1) Do "File/Export/MusiXTeX" from KGuitar. You'll get a .tex file.

2) Do

    tex your-file.tex

   (replacing "your-file" with the real name of your file, of
   course). You'll get a .dvi file.

3) You can preview a .dvi file before printing, do

    xdvi your-file.tex

   or

    kdvi your-file.tex

   depending of what sort of dvi parser you have installed with
   TeX. Preview would look ugly, anyway, because some postscript
   tricks used to make the number background clear.

4) Print the .dvi file with something like

    dvips your-file.tex

   if you have a postscript printer (or postscript filters installed),
   or something like

    dvilj your-file.tex

   if you want to use your printer's native driver (and have it
   installed too)


MIDI EXPORT
===========

MIDI export function outputs a complete midi file that can be opened
in any sequencer and played in any player or synth. Most properties of
KG files are exported, such as:

* Song name

* Song author

* Tracks' names

* MIDI channel, patches and banks selection

Tabulature effects are also emulated to get the same song in MIDI as
if played on real instrument.
