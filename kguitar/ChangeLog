	* Release 0.1

	* The first official public version. This one should be announced
	on Freshmeat and that kind of sites.

	* New basic tabulature editor. It still lacks some extended
	features like full support of effects, but the basic functionality
	is here and ready to use. Right now it's controlled only by
	keyboard, so take a look at the keyboard controls in the README
	file.

	* Chord finder is optimized much more. On my P200 it works as fast
	as Guitar Pro's one, but our version has much more features. Chord
	dialog code was cleanded up a little and new chord inversion
	control was added - be sure to check it out! Bass note control
	still isn't here, just because I couldn't find anywhere the
	accurate music theory definition of alternating bass note chords.

	* Songs could be saved and loaded in KG format (KGuitar native
	format). This format is pretty extensible and flexible and should
	be as backward compatible as possible.

	* Songs have the following properties: title, author name,
	transcriber name, comments.

	* Everything's ready for multiple tracks, though in this release
	I've not made a multitracking yet. You can edit the properties of
	each track using Edit/Track dialog, including the number and
	tuning of strings (be sure to check out the cool string thickness
	icons), number of frets, etc.

	* Pretty working exporting to ASCII tabs, so you can type in your
	tabulatures easily in KGuitar and export it to internet text-only
	form for wide usage. Importing ASCII tabs is on the way.

	* Exporting MIDI code is there, but it has fatal bugs and thereby
	disabled. If you want to play with it - enable it in sources, but
	it's broken.

	* Small options dialog just to show what degree of customizability
	we plan to implement in KGuitar. You can choose what symbols to
	describe dominant 7th chords you like the most and what symbols
	should be used for note alteration.

	* Lots of bugfixes, check the CVS logs if you care.

	* Release 0.0.2
	
	* A working release, could be helpful for somebody. Includes a pretty	
	  good chord dialog, with both chord finder and chord analyzer almost
	  totally rewritten.

	* Chord finder now works *much* faster due to precalculation. Interface
	  allows to find most chords (like major/minor, 7th, sus2, sus4, 9, 11,
	  etc). Filter found chord, based on its complexity on 3 basises: usual
	  chords, rare chords and all chords. Also, takes care about showing
	  only root forms (tonic note is bass note).
	
	* Chord analyzer now works totally different, it tries to disassemble
	  a chord from a tonic note to steps, and then assembles step record
	  again into readable chord form, thus detecing very weird (but
	  sometimes useful chord forms, such as Em6/9sus4 or C7add11 (no3)).
	  Compared to Guitar Pro chord analyzer that works on similiar concepts,
	  this chord analyzer detects more chord forms (but currently lacks
	  changed bass note detection, like Dm/E).
