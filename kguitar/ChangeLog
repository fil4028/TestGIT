	* Release 0.0.2
	
	* A working release, could be helpful for somebody. Includes a pretty	
	  good chord dialog, with both chord finder and chord analyzer almost
	  totally rewritten.

	* Chord finder now works *much* faster due to precalculation. Interface
	  allows to find most chords (like major/minor, 7th, sus2, sus4, 9, 11,
	  etc). Filter found chord, based on its complexity on 3 basises: usual
	  chords, rare chords and all chords. Also, takes care about showing
	  only root forms (tonic note is bass note).
	
	* Chord analyzer now works totally different, it tries to disassemble
	  a chord from a tonic note to steps, and then assembles step record
	  again into readable chord form, thus detecing very weird (but
	  sometimes useful chord forms, such as Em6/9sus4 or C7add11 (no3)).
	  Compared to Guitar Pro chord analyzer that works on similiar concepts,
	  this chord analyzer detects more chord forms (but currently lacks
	  changed bass note detection, like Dm/E).
