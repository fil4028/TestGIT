Instructions for new developers or just casual users
====================================================

Building KGuitar module, checked out from CVS
=============================================

After a checkout, you'll get a directory, named "kguitar" (that's where this
file resides). To build KGuitar from just checked out module, do the following:

1) make -f Makefile.cvs

That would create all required autoconf's configure scripts and automake's
Makefile.in makefiles.

2) ./configure; make; make install

As usual.


Releasing a new version
=======================

Remember, the tags look like "rel0-1".

* Update version numbers everywhere:

	configure.in.in
	VERSION

* Generate a cvslog file to help with ChangeLog writing

	svn log -r{lastrelease}:HEAD >cvslog

* Make a ChangeLog release entry, based on result cvslog file.

* Commit everything to CVS repository

* Tag everything in CVS with a new release tag

	svn copy -m "Released {major}.{minor}" https://kguitar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kguitar/trunk https://kguitar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kguitar/tags/rel{major}-{minor}

* Export everything from CVS, add the new ChangeLog

	svn export https://kguitar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kguitar/tags/rel{major}-{minor}

* Clean up CVS files and prepare a distribution:

	make -f Makefile.cvs
	make -f admin/Makefile.common dist

* Test new release


Announcing a new release
========================

Places to announce (keep ChangeLog handy, also it helps to write a
shortened version of ChangeLog for news sites):

1) Make SF.net's release
2) Send e-mail monitoring message (automatically with release)
3) Send kguitar-announce mail list post
4) Update web page; update translations if possible
5) Post news on KG project page
6) Announce on:
	freshmeat.net
	apps.kde.com
	-------------
	lrn.ru
	linux.org.ru


Update translations
===================
* Chdir to top source directory
* Do "make -f admin/Makefile.common package-messages" (use VERBOSE=1
  environment variable if you're interested in verbose report)
* Change to 'po' directory
* Do "make merge"
* Update xx.po
