Instructions for new developers or just casual users
====================================================

Building KGuitar module, checked out from CVS
=============================================

After a checkout, you'll get a directory, named "kguitar" (that's where this
file resides). To build KGuitar from just checked out module, do the following:

1) make -f Makefile.dist

That would create all required autoconf's configure scripts and automake's
Makefile.in makefiles.

2) ./configure; make; make install

As usual.

Releasing a new version
=======================

1) Update version numbers everywhere
2) Commit everything to CVS repository
3) Tag everything in CVS with tag "rel-version-number"
4) Export everything from CVS
5) Do "make -f Makefile.dist dist"
6) Changed main directory name to "kguitar-versionnumber"
7) Pack all the thing into tarball
8) Test new release
