Instructions for new developers or just casual users
====================================================

Building KGuitar module, checked out from CVS
=============================================

After a checkout, you'll get a directory, named "kguitar" (that's where this
file resides). To build KGuitar from just checked out module, do the following:

1) make -f Makefile.dist

That would create all required autoconf's configure scripts and automake's
Makefile.in makefiles.

2) ./configure; make; make install

As usual.

Releasing a new version
=======================

1) Update version numbers everywhere
2) Do "make -f Makefile.dist dist"
3) Changed main directory name to "kguitar-versionnumber"
4) Pack all the thing into tarball
5) Test new release
