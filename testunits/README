This is directory contains a tiny test unit system for KGuitar, used to
test file open/save converters. It's mostly interesting for developers,
not for end-users.

The basic idea is take a lot of original files in various foreign
formats (.gtp, .gp3, .gp4, .gp5, .ptb, etc), open them in KGuitar,
re-save as KGuitar original format (.kg) and compare the result with the
reference .kg file.

== Structure ==

Test units have the following structure. Every directory corresponds to
test unit (a group of tests, usually grouped by particular file format
to test one particular converter). Every directory of test unit includes
subdirectories:

* original - a place for original files (for example, .gp4)
* reference - a place for reference .kg files
* answer - a place that will be populated by results of conversion
* benchmark - a place for benchmarks of conversion process
* log - a place for logs of conversion

Everything except "original" and "reference" would be created
automatically in test run.

== Running ==

The simplest part. Just run shell script named "run".
