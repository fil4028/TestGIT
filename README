KGuitar v0.0.1
==============

(C) 2000, by GreyCat <yakshin@glasnet.ru>

This is the very first semi-public release of KGuitar. Most things just don't
work, and this release is almost for developers only.

The only thing worth checking out is an almost-made chord dialog. It features
two things in one - chord finder and chord analyzer.

Chord analyzer is used when chord fingering is changed using a mouse on a big
chord grid. Right list is then analyzes notes of a given chord and tries to make
a guess of what kind of chord it can be. Right now it recognizes only a little
bit of chords, but I think we could improve it in future.

Chord finder works when one selects a tonic note for a chord on the left list.
Right now it searches and finds all fingerings from 1 to 9 fret of a basic
major chord with a maximum 3 fret span. Currently this engins is very slow,
it doesn't understand various inversions of chords, can't find non 6-stringed
chords, etc, etc.

So, if you are the end-user, I guess you won't have a good usage of this program.
But... Who knows...

HOTLIST TODO: 1) autoconf/automake
              2) further KDE integration, not just Qt
              3) optimize chord finder engine
              4) enchance chord analyzer
              5) complete chord dialog into fully user-usable thing
              6) do further work on KGuitar
