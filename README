KGuitar v0.0.2
==============

(C) 2000, by GreyCat <yakshin@glasnet.ru>

This is a second public release, should be now partially usable and somewhat
useful for finding and analyzing chord fingerings by guitarists.

Nothing very visible added to this release, but:

1) Now it uses autoconf/automake, so making should be fairly easy.
2) It's much more KDE integrated, uses KDE dirs in installation, includes
   all 3 required icons for desktop (large/normal/mini), etc, etc.
3) Chord analyzer works almost perfectly - it detects almost all possible
   flavors of chords, typically about 3-4 variants for every possible fingering.
4) Chord finder is also very improved - now it's lightning fast (compared to
   old slow crawl, but it's still not a limit in optimization). Added
   user interface, required for finding all basic chord forms.

So, this one should be useful at least of chord stuff.
